# Development workflow

## The loop

1. Pick the next unblocked task from [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](https://github.com/ilyanosovsky/larder/blob/main/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
2. Branch from `main`: `feat/<task-id>-<slug>` (e.g. `feat/2.1-cart-model`), `fix/...` or `chore/...`.
3. Implement with tests (vitest). Conventional Commits.
4. Open a PR. The same PR updates the task's row in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and any affected `docs/wiki/` pages.
5. CodeRabbit reviews. Work through **every** comment: fix it, or reply with a reasoned rejection — then resolve the thread.
6. Merge (squash) when CI is green and all conversations are resolved. `main` is protected by a ruleset that applies to admins as well.

## Branch protection (ruleset on `main`)

- PR required, direct pushes blocked
- Required status check: **CI**
- Required conversation resolution — merge impossible with unresolved review threads
- Squash merge only, no force pushes, no deletions
- No bypass actors: the rules apply to admins too (platform caveat: the repo owner can still edit or delete the ruleset itself — don't)

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: lint → typecheck → vitest → build, on every PR and push to main. No secrets in CI — tests never call external services; parsers run on saved HTML fixtures.

## Wiki sync

`.github/workflows/wiki-sync.yml` publishes `docs/wiki/**` to this wiki on every merge to `main` that touches those files. The sync overwrites the wiki — never edit pages on GitHub directly. If the sync job fails with a permissions error, create a classic PAT with `repo` scope and add it as the `WIKI_TOKEN` repository secret.

## Model routing (AI-assisted development)

- **Fable** — orchestration: planning, architecture, task decomposition, reviewing subagent output, plan updates.
- **Opus** — tasks labeled `opus` in the plan (realtime infra, cart invariants, import pipeline, assistant).
- **Sonnet** — tasks labeled `sonnet` (UI screens from the design export, CRUD, seeds, settings).
